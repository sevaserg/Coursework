United States	2	1	Elvis	The most popular (in terms of number saved, not sold) commemorative stamp issued by the USPS is the 1993 Elvis stamp. Over 124 million of this colorful 29-cent stamp featuring the famous singer have been saved, nearly half again the number of the next most popular, Wonders of America, issued in 2006. Part of the success of the Elvis stamp is attributed to a survey conducted by the United Stated Postal Service. Pre-addressed ballots were available in post offices around the country, allowing people to vote on the whether they would prefer to see a heavier, older Elvis, or a younger, more slender image. More than a million ballots were received, and Young Elvis won.	3	1
United States	3	1	The Inverted Jenny	The most famous stamp in American history was a misprint. Originally issued in 1918, the 24-cent stamp shows a biplane that was mistakenly printed upside down. Only 100 of these misprinted stamps were released to the public, and philatelists have chased them ever since. One of the remaining stamps recently sold at auction for $625,000. In 2013, the USPS reprinted the Jenny, intentionally inverted this time, in a $2 denomination.	3	4
